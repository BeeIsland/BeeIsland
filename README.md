Hello, I'm Cameron Wilson

I'm an entry-level software developer that specializes in game development.

I work best with C# and Unity, but I am also experienced with C++, Unreal, HTML, JS, CSS, and SQL.

I am a graduate of The Tech Academy's Game Developer Bootcamp and I would love to join you on your project.
